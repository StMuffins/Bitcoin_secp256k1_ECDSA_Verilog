# Bitcoin_secp256k1_ECDSA_Verilog
Just the python serial communication code for now. The ECDSA was co-written by someone else, we are both up in the air in what we want to do with it. The ECDSA has been successfully synthesized onto a DE0-nano Cyclone IV and yielded results. If there is any inquiry for it please email me.
